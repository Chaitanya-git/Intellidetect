General image classification software with a Qt based frontend.

The software allows users to rapidly build and deploy Artificial Neural Networks configurable through simple config files.
The ANNs can be trained on csv datasets loaded by the user. The software also includes tools to view training stats to monitor
the training process.

Trained Neural Networks can be saved to disk and can be used to classify new images later on.
